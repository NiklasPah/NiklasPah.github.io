<p class="message">
  Welcome! I'm glad you're here. This page is all about introducing who I am and what I bring to the table as an IT consultant.
</p>

I'm Niklas Pahlke, an IT consultant with a passion for tackling new challenges and diving deep into solving complex problems. My approach combines technical expertise with a strong understanding of the business landscape, allowing me to deliver solutions that not only work but also align with strategic goals.  

My background in Computer Science (B.Sc.) is complemented by A-levels in Economics and Business, which shape my ability to grasp the "why" behind the systems I build and optimize. I bring a business mindset to every project, ensuring that technology serves its purpose effectively and efficiently.  

I have got full-stack experience, however, I have a stronger foundation and focus on the following technologies:
- Python (PyTest, FastAPI, etc.)
- CI/CD (Automation, Deployments, IaC like Terraform and Biceps)
- Azure Cloud / DevOps
- (PL/)SQL (Oracle)


If you'd like to collaborate or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or Mail. Let's create solutions that make an impact!
